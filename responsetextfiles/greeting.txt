Hi, what's up?
Hi, lovely day, isn't it?
Hi, how do you like the weather today?
Bit crowded here, isn't it?
Not much lively here tonight, eh?
Hi, how do you like the band?
Are you also waiting for the bus to?
Looks like the train is going to be late again.
Nice music, isn't it?
Shopping time again?
Sigh ... I shall be glad when this week is over! And you?
